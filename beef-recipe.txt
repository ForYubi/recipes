Step 1: Making the Ground "Beef"
Making the Ground "Beef" 
To start, preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a large baking tray with parchment and set aside.
Next, clean and trim cauliflower and cut into florets. In a food processor, pulse the cauliflower until quite fine. Transfer the cauliflower to a large bowl. Next, pulse the walnuts until their texture is similar to that of the cauliflower. Add the ground walnuts to the bowl of cauliflower.
Next, mince the garlic and add to the bowl along with the tomato paste (if using a fresh tomato, dice it first), liquid smoke, Bragg's, Chile de árbol, salt and pepper.
*NOTE: If you do not have Chile de árbol or chipotle powder, use more chili powder instead. Grind three whole Chile de árbol peppers to make your own powder. The number of peppers you add depends on your taste.
Using your hands, mix everything together until well combined. Place the mixture onto the prepared baking tray and evenly spread out.
1 medium head cauliflower
2 cups raw walnut halves
3 cloves garlic
3 tbsp tomato paste or 1 tomato
1 tsp liquid smoke
2 tbsp Bragg Liquid Aminos
1/2 tsp Chile de árbol or chipotle powder*
1/2 tsp mild chili powder
1/2 tsp sea salt
Step 2: Cooking the Vegan Ground "Beef"
Cooking the Vegan Ground "Beef"
Place the baking tray into the oven and bake for approximately 30 minutes. Then, stir the mixture, spread evenly and return to the oven. At this point, check and stir every 15 minutes until the mixture has dried and browned. The cooking time will range from 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes.
Once the “beef” is done, you can use it immediately in tacos, burritos, tomato sauce for pasta, or tossed on a salad. The mixture also works well as a filling in dishes such as lasagne or cabbage rolls.
The mixture will keep for a few days in the refrigerator. It can also be frozen.
